Deliverables:

  What problem are we addressing?
    Is a human present in an image as a service.

  Stakeholders?
    Supply chain and logistics robotics companies, various IOT products

  Context:
    Often times battery is a limiting constraint in robotic systems. By outsourcing the compute for human detection
    we are increasing the operational deployment of a robot which uses our service.

  Assesment:
    We are building a classifier, so we will use the AUROC score of our training set to evaluate performance.

  Demo:
    We will allow persons in our class to use our 'detect a human as a service' api.
